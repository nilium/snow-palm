<h2>What the Ever-Loving Hell Is Snow-Palm?</h2>

<p>Snow-Palm is a cross-platform game engine intended for use across both mobile and desktop hardware. It's written in C (and a mix of Objective-C and whatever other languages are necessary for platform-dependent code), uses OpenGL/ES for rendering, and is presently a work in progress.</p>

<p>This is more of a learning experience than anything else, though ultimately it's the open-source part of a game. The purpose of the project is fairly simple: create an engine that works in a way that is convenient, reasonably simple, and functional (in the "I can actually use this" sense, not the "no side effects" sense). In many respects, this is modeled on past experience while using the Quake 1, 2, and 3 engines, though by no means is intended to duplicate any of the three.</p>

<h2>Should I Use It?</h2>

<p>Probably not if you value your sanity. Nobody will be surprised when you start worshipping the elder gods because you tried to do something with the engine. Noel has survived mainly by seeking wisdom from Gamayun, though it's fair to say Google helped too. He does not like writing in the third person.</p>
